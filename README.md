# FinalProject-Improvement-of-Multiple-Spectral-Resolution-3D-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Hypers

This is the code for the Improvement of Multiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral image classification, the dataset that was used can be easily found in this link http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.

Improved Multiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network
This is a project for improving the Multiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network (MSR-3D CNN) for hyperspectral image classification. The goal of this project is to enhance the performance of the original MSR-3D CNN model and achieve better accuracy on hyperspectral image classification tasks.

### Getting Started
To get started with the project, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer along with the following libraries:

-NumPy

-Pandas

-TensorFlow

-Keras

You can install these libraries using pip:

### Copy code

pip install numpy pandas tensorflow keras
Once you have the required libraries installed, you can download the repository and run the Improved_Model.ipynb notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab to train and evaluate the improved MSR-3D CNN model.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Botswana dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for hyperspectral image classification. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes

### Results
The improved MSR-3D CNN model achieved an average accuracy of 98.965% on the Botswana dataset, which is a significant improvement over the original MSR-3D CNN model. The detailed results and analysis can be found in the Improved_Model.ipynb notebook.
