# FinalProject-Improvement-of-Multiple-Spectral-Resolution-3D-Convolutional-Neural-Network-for-Hypers

This is the code for the Improvement of Multiple Spectral Resolution 3D Convolutional Neural Network for Hyperspectral image classification, the dataset that was used can be easily found in this link http://www.ehu.eus/ccwintco/index.php/Hyperspectral_Remote_Sensing_Scenes.

Instrucction: 
In order for the code to work, you have to create a folder with the name Dataset and add all the datasets there. And in order to change the dataset you want to use, you can change it in the Global Variables part and change in the variable dataset according to the one you want to use, for example 'BO' for the Botswana dataset or 'SA' for the Salinas scene dataset
